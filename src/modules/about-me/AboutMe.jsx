        I’ve spent 30+ years in global media companies, leading creative, commissioning and content
        teams through an ever-changing media landscape.  I’ve held senior roles at Discovery, the BBC,

        I’ve been through reorganisations, mergers and regime-changes.
        I’ve learnt how to flex, adapt and thrive through change - understanding when and what
        to fight for and getting comfortable with risk and the possibility of failure. I’ve built and
        led dream-teams working to a core mission.  And I’ve had a great time doing it.

          <BoldInline>qualified business and personal coach</BoldInline>
        &nbsp;and a member of the International Coaching Federation, I work with executives and teams
        to unlock transformational thinking that enables them to move forwards in successful careers
        that fulfil their potential and, most importantly, bring them joy.
